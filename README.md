## How It Works

### Setting the Terms

The user will set up the terms of the payout. For this specific contract, the terms are based on how many followers the account in question must accumulate.

### Payment

The user will use Wrapped Eth (WETH) to fund the contract for the payouts, which are defined in set US Dollar terms.

### Payout

Once the marketer reaches the specified follower count, they can claim the equivalent dollar amount in ETH. The API3 dAPI oracle is used to calculate the current value of ETH to USD to ensure fair payments.
